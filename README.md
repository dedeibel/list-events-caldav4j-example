A small example on how to access a caldav calendar using caldav4j.

I created this since I couldn't find one and had to extract it from
the unit tests.

Configure ./src/test/java/benjaminpeter/name/ListCalendarTest.java

Usage: mvn test

[ListCalendarTest.java](https://github.com/dedeibel/list-events-caldav4j-example/blob/master/src/test/java/benjaminpeter/name/ListCalendarTest.java)

*yeah ... it's not actually a test*
